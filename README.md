# GetYourTester

> Expert manual testing directly in your GitHub PRs.

GetYourTester is a GitHub app that allows developers to request manual testing on their pull requests. This implementation provides a webhook server that responds to GitHub events and processes test requests.

## Features

- üöÄ **Simple Integration**: Request testing with a single comment (`/test`)
- ü§ñ **Ovi QA Agent**: AI-powered comprehensive PR analysis and test planning
- üìä **Dashboard**: View and manage test requests 
- üè∑Ô∏è **Status Tracking**: Automatically label PRs with testing status
- üí¨ **Detailed Reports**: Provide comprehensive test feedback

## Tech Stack

- Node.js/Express
- EJS templates
- Bootstrap 5
- JSON file storage (no database required)
- GitHub API via Octokit
- GitHub App authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm
- A GitHub repository with a webhook configured
- A smee.io channel for webhook proxying (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/getyourtester.git
cd getyourtester
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Server configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Session management
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key

# GitHub App configuration (recommended)
GITHUB_APP_ID=your-app-id
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# GitHub PAT (legacy, optional fallback)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token

# Webhook configuration
WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=https://smee.io/your-smee-url
ENABLE_GITHUB=true

# Notification settings
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

4. Start the webhook server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. In a separate terminal, start the smee client to forward GitHub webhooks:

```bash
npm run webhook
```

6. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application
7. Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard to view test requests

### GitHub App Authentication

GetYourTester uses GitHub App authentication for secure, repository-specific access. This allows the app to:

1. Access repositories where it's installed
2. Use repository-specific permissions
3. Work across multiple GitHub accounts

#### Setting up GitHub App Authentication

1. Create a GitHub App in your GitHub account:
   - Go to Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps
   - Click "New GitHub App"
   - Set the app name, homepage URL, and webhook URL
   - Configure permissions:
     - Repository permissions: Contents (Read & write), Issues (Read & write), Pull requests (Read & write)
   - Generate a private key and download it

2. Add the GitHub App credentials to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GITHUB_APP_ID=your-app-id
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
   ```

3. Install the app on repositories where you want to use GetYourTester

#### Legacy PAT Authentication (Fallback)

For backward compatibility, GetYourTester can also use a Personal Access Token (PAT):

1. Create a PAT with repo, issues, and pull_request scopes
2. Add it to your `.env` file as `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. The app will use the PAT as a fallback if GitHub App authentication fails

### Usage

1. Make sure your GitHub repository has a webhook configured to:
   - Send events to your smee.io URL
   - Send "Issue comments" events
   - Content type should be "application/json"

2. Create a pull request in your repository
3. Comment `/test` on the PR to request testing
4. The webhook server will:
   - Add a "testing-requested" label to the PR
   - **ü§ñ Ovi QA Agent analyzes the PR** and generates comprehensive insights
   - Post an acknowledgment comment with AI-powered analysis
   - Store the test request in the local database
   - (Optionally) Send a notification email

5. View the test request in the dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## Webhook Implementation

The webhook implementation consists of two main components:

1. **webhook-server.js**: The main Express server that receives webhook events and processes them
2. **fixed-webhook.js**: A client that connects to smee.io and forwards events to the local server

When a PR comment containing "/test" is received:

```
GitHub PR Comment ‚Üí GitHub Webhook ‚Üí smee.io ‚Üí fixed-webhook.js ‚Üí webhook-server.js ‚Üí githubService
```

The githubService then:
1. Creates a test request record
2. **ü§ñ Ovi QA Agent analyzes the PR** (code changes, risks, test coverage)
3. Posts an acknowledgment comment with comprehensive AI insights
4. Adds a label to the PR
5. Stores the test request for the dashboard

## ü§ñ Ovi QA Agent

GetYourTester now features **Ovi**, an AI-powered QA Agent that provides comprehensive analysis of your pull requests.

### What Ovi Analyzes

When you comment `/test` on a PR, Ovi automatically:

1. **üîç Change Review**
   - Analyzes PR metadata (title, description, comments)
   - Identifies potential ambiguity or missing requirements
   - Generates smart questions a QA engineer would ask
   - Assesses risks and edge cases
   - Provides a **Production Readiness Score** (1-10) with business-focused assessment

2. **üß™ Test Recipe**
   - Creates comprehensive test scenarios (Critical Path, General, Edge Cases)
   - Suggests automation plans (Unit, Integration, E2E tests)
   - Provides specific test cases with actionable steps

3. **üìä Code Quality Assessment**
   - Identifies affected modules and dependencies
   - Analyzes existing test coverage and gaps
   - Recommends best practices and improvements

### Production Readiness Scoring

Ovi uses a business-focused scoring system (1-10) to assess release readiness:

- **üöÄ 9-10: Ship It!** - No critical issues, ready for production
- **‚úÖ 7-8: Ship with Monitoring** - Minor issues, can be monitored and fixed quickly
- **‚ö†Ô∏è 5-6: Needs More Testing** - Potential issues affecting some users
- **‚ùå 3-4: Block Release** - Issues that could significantly impact customer experience
- **üö® 1-2: Critical Block** - Critical bugs that will definitely affect customers

The scoring considers business impact, customer happiness, and technical quality from a Founder/PM/QA perspective.

### Example Output

```
### ü§ñ Ovi QA Assistant by GetYourTester

#### üîç Change Review
**Key Questions:**
- How does this authentication change affect existing user sessions?
- Are there proper error handling mechanisms for invalid tokens?

**Risks:**
- Potential security vulnerability in token validation
- Missing rate limiting on login endpoints

**Production Readiness Score:** ‚úÖ **8/10 - Ship with Monitoring**

*This change is ready for production with minor monitoring needed. Core functionality works well, but some edge cases should be watched.*

#### üß™ Test Recipe
**Critical Path:**
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
- [ ] Token validation for protected routes

**Automation Plan:**
- Unit: Test JWT token generation and validation functions
- Integration: Test login endpoint with database integration
- E2E: Complete user authentication flow
```

### Testing Ovi QA Agent

Run the test script to verify Ovi's functionality:

```bash
npm run test:ovi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Website Routes Not Working (Contact, About, etc.)

If you notice that routes like `/contact`, `/about`, `/how-it-works`, or `/pricing` are not working, make sure that the `webhook-server.js` file properly imports and uses the routes from `src/routes/index.js`:

```javascript
// In webhook-server.js
const indexRoutes = require('./src/routes/index');

// Add this after middleware setup
app.use('/', indexRoutes);
```

This ensures that all the public website routes defined in `src/routes/index.js` are available when running the server.
