# Demo Screenshots

To complete the demo section, save your actual screenshots with these exact filenames:

1. **ovi-pr-analysis-demo.png** - The GitHub PR analysis screenshot showing Ovi's QA analysis
2. **ovi-risk-analysis-demo.png** - The risk analysis screenshot showing "Key Questions, Risks & Bugs"

## Instructions:
1. Save the GitHub PR analysis screenshot as `ovi-pr-analysis-demo.png`
2. Save the risk analysis screenshot as `ovi-risk-analysis-demo.png`
3. Place both files in this `/public/images/` directory
4. The landing page will automatically display these screenshots in the demo section

The screenshots should be high-quality PNG files that clearly show Ovi's analysis output in GitHub pull requests.
