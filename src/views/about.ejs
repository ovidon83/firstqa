          <p class="lead">We believe that quality software requires thorough testing. Automated tests are essential, but they can't catch everything.</p>
          <p>GetYourTester was founded with a simple mission: to make expert manual testing accessible to all development teams. We bridge the gap between automated testing and real-world usage, finding the issues that automation misses.</p>
          <p>By providing on-demand manual testing directly integrated with GitHub, we help development teams ship with confidence, knowing their changes have been thoroughly tested by experts.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Why Manual Testing Matters</h3>
              <p>While automated tests are crucial for regression testing and continuous integration, they have limitations:</p>
              <ul class="mb-0">
                <li>They only test what you've programmed them to test</li>
                <li>They can't evaluate subjective aspects like user experience</li>
                <li>They don't mimic real user behavior and unexpected paths</li>
                <li>They don't catch visual or cross-browser issues</li>
              </ul>
