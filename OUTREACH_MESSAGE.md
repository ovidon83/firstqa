# 🚀 Hey Startup Founder! Ready to Ship with Confidence?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're building [their product/company] - looks awesome! 👏

As a fellow founder, I know the struggle: **shipping fast while maintaining quality**. You're probably wearing multiple hats, and QA often gets pushed to the back burner... until bugs hit production. 😅

**What if I told you there's a way to get senior QA expertise in seconds, not weeks?**

## Meet FirstQA - Your AI QA Agent + Human Experts

I built FirstQA because I was tired of:
