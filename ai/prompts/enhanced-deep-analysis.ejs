  - **Exact behaviors**: No flicker (verify this specifically), no disappearing unexpectedly (verify item remains visible), smooth transitions (verify this)
  - **What should NOT happen**: List specific things that should NOT occur (e.g., "UI should NOT flicker", "Item should NOT disappear", "Filter should NOT switch unexpectedly")
- **EDGE CASES**: Include important edge cases (rapid actions, multiple states, concurrent operations, boundary conditions)
- **NEGATIVE TESTS**: Include negative test cases (error conditions, failure scenarios, invalid states)
- **COMPLETE USER FLOWS**: Test full user journeys, not just isolated actions
- Generate 5-7 comprehensive test cases total, prioritizing fixes and user-facing changes
- **ONE TEST CASE PER FIX**: Each distinct fix mentioned in commits should get its own dedicated test case

**IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** extract and specify exact return values, thresholds, constants, and enum values from the code
- **NEVER** use generic descriptions like "correct status", "proper values", or "handles gracefully"
- **INCLUDE** specific numeric thresholds, boolean conditions, and all possible return states
- When analyzing any function or component:
  - Extract all conditional logic and their exact conditions
  - Identify all possible return paths and their specific values
  - Note any magic numbers or constants used
  - Include specific line numbers for complex logic sections
- Replace generic expected results with implementation-specific ones:
  - Instead of "Function returns correct result", specify "Function returns 'status_a' when condition > threshold, 'status_b' when condition < threshold, otherwise 'status_c'"
- For any calculation, validation, or conditional logic:
  - Test exact threshold values
  - Test just below and above thresholds
  - Test edge cases (empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions)
  - Test all possible enum/state values
- Provide concrete test data examples that demonstrate:
  - Each possible return value/state

- Let the code speak for itself in the analysis

**ENHANCED TEST GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Algorithm-Aware Analysis**: Identify algorithms, data structures, and computational patterns in the code changes
- **Algorithmic Edge Cases**: Generate test cases for major algorithmic edge cases (empty inputs, boundary conditions, overflow scenarios, race conditions)
- **Boundary Value Testing**: Include boundary tests (min, max, min-1, max+1, empty, null) only when valuable and addressing real risks
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight test scenarios by combining code complexity (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth) and user impact (user-facing features, business logic)
- **Code-Specific Scenarios**: Extract test scenarios directly from code changes, function parameters, return values, and error handling patterns
- **Realistic Test Data**: Generate specific, realistic test data examples that match the code's expectations (avoid overloading)
- **Performance Analysis**: Include tests for algorithmic complexity issues, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks
- **Concurrency Testing**: Add tests for race conditions and thread safety when applicable

- For Test Recipe: 
  - **STEP 1: CODE ANALYSIS** (MUST DO FIRST):
    - Read through the CODE DIFF carefully
    - Extract exact UI element names (buttons: "Mark as Shared", filters: "Draft"/"Shared"/"All", etc.)
    - Extract exact function names (e.g., `handleMarkAsShared`, `switchFilter`, etc.)
    - Extract exact variable/state names (e.g., `selectedThought`, `activeFilter`, `isShared`, etc.)
    - Extract exact strings/messages from code (e.g., toast messages: "Marked as shared! ✔", "Switched to 'All' view...")
    - Extract exact badge/visual indicator names (e.g., "Shared" badge, "In Share Journey" badge, etc.)
    - Understand conditional logic: when filters switch, when items appear/disappear, when toasts show
    - Map out the exact flow: user action → state change → UI update → toast notification
  - **STEP 2: TEST CASE GENERATION**:
    - Generate **5-7 comprehensive test cases** total, prioritizing fixes and user-facing changes
    - **CRITICAL**: For EACH distinct fix mentioned in commit messages, generate a SEPARATE test case that specifically verifies that fix
    - Include ALL priority levels: Happy Path, Critical Path, Edge Case, Negative Test, and Regression
    - Order scenarios by priority (Happy Path first, then Critical Path, Edge Case/Negative Test, then Regression)
    - **TEST CASE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**
      - **Scenario Name**: Descriptive name focusing on what's being tested (e.g., "Mark as Shared from Draft Filter", "Verify Flicker Fix", "Rapid Toggle Mark/Unmark")
      - **Steps**: Detailed, numbered steps with SPECIFIC actions using EXACT names from code:
        - **Setup/Initial State**: 
          - Exact filter active (use exact filter name from code: "Draft", "Shared", "All", etc.)
          - Exact selection state (which item is selected, how it's identified)
          - Exact data state (item properties, shared status, platforms, etc.)
          - Exact UI state (what's visible, what badges/indicators are shown)
        - **Actions**: 
          - Exact button/link names as they appear in code (e.g., "Mark as Shared", "Mark as Draft")
          - Exact selection actions (e.g., "Select thought with ID X")
          - Use exact terminology from the code
        - Use multiline format with `<br>` tags for readability
      - **Expected Result**: EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE expected behaviors using EXACT details from code:
        - **Exact UI states** (use exact names from code):
          - Exact filter state: "Filter switches from 'Draft' to 'All'" (use exact filter names)
          - Exact visibility: "Thought remains visible in the list" (specify which list)
          - Exact selection: "Thought remains selected" (or "Selection clears" or "Another thought auto-selects")
        - **Exact toast messages** (copy exactly from code):
          - Full text: "Toast notification appears with message: 'Marked as shared! ✔ LinkedIn'" (exact text)
          - Additional text: "Toast also shows: 'Switched to 'All' view to keep it visible'" (if present)

          - "Thought shared status changes from draft to shared on LinkedIn platform"
          - "Selection state changes from thought A to thought B"
        - **Exact behaviors** (be specific about what should happen):
          - "No UI flicker occurs during the action"
          - "Smooth transition without page reload"
          - "Thought scrolls into view if it moves position"
          - "Toast notification appears and auto-dismisses after X seconds" (if specified)
        - **What should NOT happen** (be explicit):
          - "UI should NOT flicker"
          - "Thought should NOT disappear from view unexpectedly"
          - "Filter should NOT switch unless explicitly triggered by the logic"
          - "No errors should appear in console"
      - **Priority**: Appropriate priority based on impact (Happy Path/Critical Path/Edge Case/Negative Test/Regression)
    - **INCLUDE EDGE CASES**: Important edge cases like rapid actions, multiple states, concurrent operations, boundary conditions
    - **INCLUDE NEGATIVE TESTS**: Error conditions, failure scenarios, invalid states, things that should NOT happen
    - Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality, especially fixes mentioned in commits
    - Make steps detailed, actionable, and specific to the actual code changes
    - **Priority Examples**: 
      - Fix verification = Critical Path (HIGH) - each fix gets its own test case
      - Core user workflow = Happy Path (HIGH)
      - Error handling = Negative Test (MEDIUM-HIGH)
      - Rapid actions/multiple states = Edge Case (MEDIUM-HIGH)
      - Existing features = Regression (HIGH)
    - **Test Fixes Directly**: If commit says "prevent thoughts from disappearing", test case should verify thoughts don't disappear with exact UI states
    - **Test Complete Flows**: Test full user journeys, not just isolated actions
    - **Specific Expected Results**: Never use generic descriptions like "works correctly" - use exact UI states, messages, behaviors extracted from code
    - **One Test Case Per Fix**: Each distinct fix should get its own dedicated test case

No-Go if confidence is low, critical path has high risk, or severe bugs/risks without mitigations. MAX 15 words.
- For Steps: Use HTML line breaks within table cells to ensure proper formatting:
  - Each step must be on its own line using `<br>` tags
  - Example format: `1. Open the form<br>2. Fill in required fields<br>3. Submit the form`
  - NOT: "1. Open form 2. Fill fields 3. Submit"
  - This ensures the table displays steps as proper numbered lists
