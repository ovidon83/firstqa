**STEP 0: SMART FILE TYPE ANALYSIS (DO THIS FIRST)**

Before analyzing anything, categorize the changed files:

**CODE FILES** (require full analysis):
- `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.java`, `.go`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.rs`, `.vue`, `.svelte`
- Configuration files that affect runtime: `.json` (package.json, tsconfig), `.yaml`/`.yml` (CI/CD, docker-compose), `.env` files
- Database files: `.sql`, migrations

**NON-CODE FILES** (low risk, minimal analysis needed):
- Documentation: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.doc`, `.pdf`
- Images: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.ico`, `.webp`
- Styles only: `.css`, `.scss`, `.less` (unless they affect critical UI)
- Test data: `.json` data files, fixtures, mocks
- Git files: `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- IDE/editor: `.vscode`, `.idea`, `.editorconfig`
- Build artifacts: `.lock` files (unless security-relevant)

**SMART ANALYSIS RULES:**
1. **If ALL files are non-code**: 
   - Release Confidence: 🟢 High
   - Change Impact: 🟢 Low
   - Release Decision: 🟢 Go
   - Code Review: "No code changes to review."
   - Bugs: "No bugs identified - non-code changes only."
   - Test Recipe: Simple verification test only (e.g., "Verify file exists and is readable")
   
2. **If changes are documentation/text only**:
   - Focus on: typos, broken links, formatting issues
   - Don't generate code-related test cases
   - Be concise - documentation changes are low risk
   
3. **If changes are config files**:
   - Check for: syntax errors, missing required fields, security settings
   - Only flag as risk if config affects production/security
   
4. **If changes mix code and non-code**:
   - Focus analysis on code files only
   - Mention non-code changes briefly in summary

**CRITICAL: Before generating test cases, you MUST:**
1. **ANALYZE THE CODE DIFF DEEPLY** to extract exact details:
   - Identify all UI elements mentioned (buttons, filters, badges, toasts, notifications)
   - Extract exact function names, variable names, component names
   - Understand the exact flow/logic: what triggers what, when, and how
   - Identify state changes: what state variables exist, how they change
   - Extract exact strings/messages used in the code (toast messages, labels, button text)
   - Identify visual indicators: badges, borders, highlights, colors, icons
   - Understand conditional logic: when things appear/disappear, when filters switch
2. **USE EXACT CODE DETAILS** in test cases - don't guess or use generic terms
3. **REFERENCE ACTUAL CODE ELEMENTS** by their names as they appear in the diff

**PR CONTEXT:**
Title: <%= title %>
Description: <%= body %>

**FILES CHANGED:**
<%= changedFiles.join(', ') %>

**CODE DIFF (ANALYZE THIS DEEPLY FOR EXACT DETAILS):**
<%= diff %>

**ADVANCED CODE ANALYSIS:**
<%= codeContext %>
<% if (typeof selectorHintsFormatted !== 'undefined' && selectorHintsFormatted && selectorHintsFormatted !== 'None extracted.') { %>
**AUTOMATION SELECTORS (use these in test steps when applicable - enables Playwright/automation):**
<%= selectorHintsFormatted %>
<% } %>
<% if (typeof fileContentsForPrompt !== 'undefined' && fileContentsForPrompt) { %>
**FULL FILE CONTENTS (key changed files - use for exact UI elements, component structure, strings):**
<%= fileContentsForPrompt %>
<% } %>

## 🔍 Code Review & Bugs

[AI will generate a bullet list of code issues and bugs, SORTED BY SEVERITY (blockers first, then high, then medium):
- Every item MUST include `file:line` reference
- Format: "[SEVERITY] Issue description at `file.js:line` — impact"
- Severity markers: 🚫 BLOCKER (must fix before release), 🔴 HIGH, 🟡 MEDIUM
- Example: "🔴 Null check missing: `user.profile.name` at `src/Button.js:56` — crashes if profile is null"
- Example: "🚫 BLOCKER: Data corruption risk in `scripts/sql/migrations/add_reaction_breakdown.sql:18` — overwrites NULL with zeros"
- If nothing found: "✅ No critical issues found."
- MAX 6 items — focus on real issues that affect quality, no false positives]

## 🧪 Test Recipe

| Scenario | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
|----------|-------|-----------------|----------|
[AI will generate test cases here — ORDERED BY PRIORITY (High first, then Medium)]

**TEST CASE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ORDER BY PRIORITY**: High priority tests first, then Medium
- **SCENARIO**: Clear, specific name describing what's being tested (e.g., "Verify thought stays visible after marking as shared")
- **STEPS** (automation-ready - atomic, unambiguous, executable):
  - One action per step. Each step must be a single, concrete action a human or Playwright could perform.
  - Use exact UI names/labels from code. When AUTOMATION SELECTORS exist above, include them in format: `[data-testid="value"]` or `aria-label="value"` in parentheses after the human-readable action.
  - Example: `1. Navigate to ActView (or /act-view)<br>2. Click thought "My First Thought" (or element with data-testid="thought-item")<br>3. Click "Mark as Shared" button (or [data-testid="mark-shared-btn"])`
  - Steps must be sequential, unambiguous, and verifiable. Avoid vague actions like "verify it works".
- **EXPECTED RESULT**: Specific, verifiable outcomes with exact details from code. Use `<br>` for multiple expectations:
  - `Thought remains visible in list<br>Toast shows "Marked as shared! ✔"<br>Badge "Shared" appears on thought`
- **PRIORITY**: High (core flows, fixes) or Medium (edge cases, validations)

- **INCLUDE** specific numeric thresholds, boolean conditions, and all possible return states
- When analyzing any function or component:
  - Extract all conditional logic and their exact conditions
  - Identify all possible return paths and their specific values
  - Note any magic numbers or constants used
  - Include specific line numbers for complex logic sections
- Replace generic expected results with implementation-specific ones:
  - Instead of "Function returns correct result", specify "Function returns 'status_a' when condition > threshold, 'status_b' when condition < threshold, otherwise 'status_c'"
- For any calculation, validation, or conditional logic:
  - Test exact threshold values
  - Test just below and above thresholds

- Let the code speak for itself in the analysis

**ENHANCED TEST GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Algorithm-Aware Analysis**: Identify algorithms, data structures, and computational patterns in the code changes
- **Algorithmic Edge Cases**: Generate test cases for major algorithmic edge cases (empty inputs, boundary conditions, overflow scenarios, race conditions)
- **Boundary Value Testing**: Include boundary tests (min, max, min-1, max+1, empty, null) only when valuable and addressing real risks
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight test scenarios by combining code complexity (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth) and user impact (user-facing features, business logic)
- **Code-Specific Scenarios**: Extract test scenarios directly from code changes, function parameters, return values, and error handling patterns
- **Realistic Test Data**: Generate specific, realistic test data examples that match the code's expectations (avoid overloading)
- **Performance Analysis**: Include tests for algorithmic complexity issues, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks
- **Concurrency Testing**: Add tests for race conditions and thread safety when applicable

- For Test Recipe: 
  - **STEP 1: CODE ANALYSIS** (MUST DO FIRST):
    - Read through the CODE DIFF carefully
    - Extract exact UI element names (buttons: "Mark as Shared", filters: "Draft"/"Shared"/"All", etc.)
    - Extract exact function names (e.g., `handleMarkAsShared`, `switchFilter`, etc.)
    - Extract exact variable/state names (e.g., `selectedThought`, `activeFilter`, `isShared`, etc.)

    - Understand conditional logic: when filters switch, when items appear/disappear, when toasts show
    - Map out the exact flow: user action → state change → UI update → toast notification
  - **STEP 2: TEST CASE GENERATION**:
    - Generate **5-7 comprehensive test cases** total, prioritizing fixes and user-facing changes
    - **CRITICAL**: For EACH distinct fix mentioned in commit messages, generate a SEPARATE test case that specifically verifies that fix
    - Include ALL priority levels: Happy Path, Critical Path, Edge Case, Negative Test, and Regression
    - Order scenarios by priority (Happy Path first, then Critical Path, Edge Case/Negative Test, then Regression)
    - **TEST CASE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**
      - **Scenario Name**: Descriptive name focusing on what's being tested (e.g., "Mark as Shared from Draft Filter", "Verify Flicker Fix", "Rapid Toggle Mark/Unmark")
      - **Steps** (automation-ready - atomic, one action per step, executable by Playwright):
        - **Setup/Initial State**: 
          - Exact filter active (use exact filter name from code: "Draft", "Shared", "All", etc.)
          - Exact selection state (which item is selected, how it's identified)
          - Exact data state (item properties, shared status, platforms, etc.)
          - Exact UI state (what's visible, what badges/indicators are shown)
        - **Actions** (one action per step; include selector in parentheses when AUTOMATION SELECTORS exist):
          - Exact button/link names as they appear in code (e.g., "Mark as Shared", "Mark as Draft")
          - When selectors available: "Click 'Submit' (data-testid='submit-btn')" or "Fill email field (name='email')"
          - Each step = one navigator/click/type/select/verify action. No compound steps.
        - Use multiline format with `<br>` tags for readability
      - **Expected Result**: EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE expected behaviors using EXACT details from code:
        - **Exact UI states** (use exact names from code):
          - Exact filter state: "Filter switches from 'Draft' to 'All'" (use exact filter names)
          - Exact visibility: "Thought remains visible in the list" (specify which list)
          - Exact selection: "Thought remains selected" (or "Selection clears" or "Another thought auto-selects")

          - "Selection state changes from thought A to thought B"
        - **Exact behaviors** (be specific about what should happen):
          - "No UI flicker occurs during the action"
          - "Smooth transition without page reload"
          - "Thought scrolls into view if it moves position"
          - "Toast notification appears and auto-dismisses after X seconds" (if specified)
        - **What should NOT happen** (be explicit):
          - "UI should NOT flicker"
          - "Thought should NOT disappear from view unexpectedly"
          - "Filter should NOT switch unless explicitly triggered by the logic"
          - "No errors should appear in console"
      - **Priority**: Appropriate priority based on impact (Happy Path/Critical Path/Edge Case/Negative Test/Regression)
    - **ONLY INCLUDE RELEVANT TEST CASES**: Test cases must be directly related to the changes in the PR/commits
    - **AVOID GENERIC TEST CASES**: Don't include generic test cases like "Error Handling on Update Failure" or "Memory Leak Prevention" unless they are specifically related to the actual changes
    - **FOCUS ON CHANGES**: Every test case should test something that was actually changed, added, fixed, or removed in this PR
    - **INCLUDE EDGE CASES**: Important edge cases that are directly related to the changes (rapid actions, multiple states, boundary conditions for the changed functionality)
    - **INCLUDE NEGATIVE TESTS**: Error conditions, failure scenarios for the specific changes made
    - Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality, especially fixes mentioned in commits
    - Make steps detailed, actionable, and specific to the actual code changes
    - If a test case doesn't clearly relate to the changes, don't include it
    - **ORDER TEST CASES BY PRIORITY**: High priority tests MUST come first in the table, then Medium
    - **Priority Examples**: 
      - Fix verification = High (each fix gets its own test case)
      - Core user workflow = High
      - Error handling = Negative Test (MEDIUM-HIGH)
      - Rapid actions/multiple states = Edge Case (MEDIUM-HIGH)
      - Existing features = Regression (HIGH)
    - **Test Fixes Directly**: If commit says "prevent thoughts from disappearing", test case should verify thoughts don't disappear with exact UI states
    - **Test Complete Flows**: Test full user journeys, not just isolated actions
    - **Specific Expected Results**: Never use generic descriptions like "works correctly" - use exact UI states, messages, behaviors extracted from code
    - **One Test Case Per Fix**: Each distinct fix should get its own dedicated test case

- For Code Review & Bugs (MERGED SECTION):
  - **ONLY SIGNAL, NO NOISE**: Trustworthy for developers. Only real, verifiable issues - NO FALSE POSITIVES.
  - **REQUIRED**: Every item MUST include exact file name and line number (e.g., `src/api/user.js:45`)
  - **MAX 6 ITEMS**: Only critical issues that affect quality. Less is more.
  - **SORT BY SEVERITY**: 🚫 BLOCKER items first, then 🔴 HIGH, then 🟡 MEDIUM
  - **MARK BLOCKERS**: Use 🚫 BLOCKER for issues that must be fixed before release (security, data corruption, critical path breaks)
  - **FORMAT**: `[SEVERITY] Issue type: Description at \`file:line\` - impact`
  - **If nothing found**: Write ONLY "✅ No critical issues found." - DO NOT add any other text like "in other areas" or explanations
  - **DO NOT ADD**: Do not add any additional text after listing issues. No summaries, no "other areas", no extra explanations.
- For Release Pulse:
  - **Release Decision**: First row. Evaluate based on actual findings in Code Review & Bugs:
    - 🟢 Go: No blockers, safe to release after testing passes
    - 🟡 Caution: Some concerns that need review before release
    - 🔴 No-Go: Clear blockers exist (specify what they are)
  - **Affected Areas**: Second row. List 2-4 specific components/services/modules touched. Use actual names from code.
  - **Risk Level**: Third row. Assess overall risk (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low) based on: bugs found, security concerns, data integrity risks, missing validation. Explain the main risk factors briefly.
- For Steps: Use HTML line breaks within table cells to ensure proper formatting:
  - Each step must be on its own line using `<br>` tags
  - Example format: `1. Open the form<br>2. Fill in required fields<br>3. Submit the form`
  - NOT: "1. Open form 2. Fill fields 3. Submit"
  - This ensures the table displays steps as proper numbered lists

**REMEMBER: STOP YOUR OUTPUT AFTER THE "🧪 Test Recipe" TABLE. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INSTRUCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL TEXT.**
