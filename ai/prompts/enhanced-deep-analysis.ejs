**CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR OUTPUT - THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU ONLY:**

- Focus specifically on the actual code changes made in this PR
- **What areas of the system does this touch (directly or indirectly)?** Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact and regression risks
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Look for potential performance, security, or accessibility implications from the actual code
- **Test recipe based on the diff + other impacted files — no guessing, no overtesting**
- **Identify assumptions, missing context, suspicious diffs**
- Prioritize tests using unified system:
  - **Happy Path**: Core functionality that works as intended
  - **Critical Path**: Important scenarios that must work correctly
  - **Edge Case**: Edge cases and error conditions
  - **Regression**: Existing functionality that might be affected by these changes (based on Product Areas affected)
- Provide concrete, actionable test steps based on the real changes
- Consider the full user journey and potential impact areas
- Include comprehensive test coverage while being specific to this PR
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones

**IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS** extract and specify exact return values, thresholds, constants, and enum values from the code
- **NEVER** use generic descriptions like "correct status", "proper values", or "handles gracefully"
- **INCLUDE** specific numeric thresholds, boolean conditions, and all possible return states
- When analyzing any function or component:
  - Extract all conditional logic and their exact conditions
  - Identify all possible return paths and their specific values
  - Note any magic numbers or constants used
  - Include specific line numbers for complex logic sections
- Replace generic expected results with implementation-specific ones:
  - Instead of "Function returns correct result", specify "Function returns 'status_a' when condition > threshold, 'status_b' when condition < threshold, otherwise 'status_c'"
- For any calculation, validation, or conditional logic:
  - Test exact threshold values
  - Test just below and above thresholds
  - Test edge cases (empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions)
  - Test all possible enum/state values
- Provide concrete test data examples that demonstrate:
  - Each possible return value/state
  - Boundary conditions
  - Edge cases
  - Realistic usage scenarios
- Instead of generic error handling descriptions, specify:
  - Exact error messages that should appear
  - Specific fallback values or default states
  - Precise UI behavior during error states
  - Recovery mechanisms
- When identifying performance concerns:
  - Specify exact line numbers and operations
  - Identify specific algorithms or patterns causing issues
  - Suggest concrete optimization approaches
  - Provide scalability thresholds
- Before finalizing analysis, verify:
  - All return values and states are explicitly stated
  - All thresholds and constants are specified
  - Concrete test data examples are provided
  - Boundary conditions are covered
  - Error handling specifics are detailed with exact behaviors
  - Line numbers match actual code locations
  - Performance concerns include specific operations and locations
  - Test scenarios are immediately actionable without additional investigation
- Focus purely on code implementation, not assumptions about business logic
- Extract facts from the code rather than making inferences
- Provide specific, verifiable details rather than general statements
- Let the code speak for itself in the analysis

**ENHANCED TEST GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Algorithm-Aware Analysis**: Identify algorithms, data structures, and computational patterns in the code changes
- **Algorithmic Edge Cases**: Generate test cases for major algorithmic edge cases (empty inputs, boundary conditions, overflow scenarios, race conditions)
- **Boundary Value Testing**: Include boundary tests (min, max, min-1, max+1, empty, null) only when valuable and addressing real risks
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Weight test scenarios by combining code complexity (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth) and user impact (user-facing features, business logic)
- **Code-Specific Scenarios**: Extract test scenarios directly from code changes, function parameters, return values, and error handling patterns
- **Realistic Test Data**: Generate specific, realistic test data examples that match the code's expectations (avoid overloading)
- **Performance Analysis**: Include tests for algorithmic complexity issues, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks
- **Concurrency Testing**: Add tests for race conditions and thread safety when applicable

- For Test Recipe: 
  - Include ALL priority levels: Happy Path, Critical Path, Edge Case, and Regression
  - Order scenarios by priority (Happy Path first, then Critical Path, Edge Case, then Regression)
  - Within each priority level, order by relevance to the actual PR changes
  - **For each priority level, include BOTH positive and negative scenarios:**
    - Start with **positive test cases** (happy path, successful workflows)
    - Then include **negative test cases** (error conditions, edge cases, failure scenarios)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Scenario names should be descriptive and concise WITHOUT prefixes like "Positive Scenario:" or "Negative Scenario:"
  - Examples: "User Login Success", "Invalid Credentials", "Password Reset Flow", "Session Timeout"
  - Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality and affected product areas
  - Make steps detailed, actionable, and multiline-friendly
  - Evaluate which scenarios make most sense given the specific changes in the PR
  - **Priority Examples**: User login = Happy Path, form validation = Critical Path, network timeout = Edge Case, existing user flows = Regression
  - **Enhanced Test Data**: Include specific input examples only when they help clarify test execution
  - **Algorithmic Tests**: Add tests for sorting, searching, hashing, and other algorithmic operations
  - **Boundary Tests**: Include tests for numeric boundaries, array bounds, string lengths, and data limits
  - **Complexity Tests**: Prioritize tests for high-complexity functions and critical user-facing features

- For Questions, Risks & Bugs: 
  - ACTUALLY ANALYZE the code changes to see if they affect other modules/components/files
  - If dependencies are found, specify exactly which files/modules are affected and how
  - If no dependencies found, don't mention generic "could affect" statements
  - Look for actual code issues like missing error handling, potential null pointer exceptions, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or integration problems that are visible in the diff
  - Give concrete results, not generic questions
  - Avoid duplication between questions/risks and bugs - consolidate similar concerns
  - **IMPORTANT**: Always provide exactly 3 items total, with this specific format:
    - 1 Risk: Focus on potential runtime issues, security vulnerabilities, or performance problems
    - 1 Bug: Focus on actual code defects or missing error handling
    - 1 Question: Focus on edge cases or integration concerns
  - **Example format**:
    - **Risk**: "Missing null check for user input could cause runtime errors (line 45)"
    - **Bug**: "No error handling when API call fails (lines 67-72)"
    - **Question**: "How does this handle concurrent user access?"
- For Product Areas: Identify specific features, modules, user flows, or business processes that are directly affected by the code changes
- For Release Pulse Analysis:
  - **Release Confidence**: Evaluate test coverage, presence of test files, handling of edge cases, and overall implementation confidence. MAX 15 words.
  - **Change Impact**: Evaluate scope of code diff — number of files, components/modules touched, shared or risky areas. MAX 15 words.
  - **Release Decision**: Recommend Go or No-Go based on a weighted judgment of the above. Go if value is meaningful, confidence is high/medium, and impact is low/medium. No-Go if confidence is low or impact is high without mitigations. MAX 15 words.
- For Steps: Use HTML line breaks within table cells to ensure proper formatting:
  - Each step must be on its own line using `<br>` tags
  - Example format: `1. Open the form<br>2. Fill in required fields<br>3. Submit the form`
  - NOT: "1. Open form 2. Fill fields 3. Submit"
  - This ensures the table displays steps as proper numbered lists

**REMEMBER: STOP YOUR OUTPUT AFTER THE "🎯 Product Areas Affected" SECTION. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INSTRUCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL TEXT.**
