## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Questions & Risks

**Based on actual code changes and diff analysis:**

1. **[Functional]** [Specific question about implementation based on code changes]
2. **[Performance]** [Performance concern from actual code if applicable]
3. **[Security]** [Security risk from code if applicable]
4. **[Integration]** [Integration risk from dependencies if applicable]
5. **[Regression]** [Specific regression risk based on affected product areas]

*Focus on concrete risks from the code, not general best practices. Always specify file names with line numbers.*

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (Do not include in output):**
- Focus specifically on the actual code changes made in this PR
- Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact and regression risks
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Look for potential performance, security, or accessibility implications from the actual code
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature + critical path, High = important supporting functionality
- Provide concrete, actionable test steps based on the real changes
- Consider the full user journey and potential impact areas
- Include comprehensive test coverage while being specific to this PR
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones
- For Questions & Risks: 
  - ACTUALLY ANALYZE the code changes to see if they affect other modules/components/files
  - If dependencies are found, specify exactly which files/modules are affected and how
  - If no dependencies found, don't mention generic "could affect" statements
  - Look for actual code issues like missing error handling, potential null pointer exceptions, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or integration problems that are visible in the diff
  - Give concrete results, not generic questions
- For Test Recipe: Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality, not generic test cases
- Make every question and risk actionable and specific to the actual code changes
