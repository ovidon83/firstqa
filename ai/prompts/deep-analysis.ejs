**CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR OUTPUT - THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU ONLY:**

- Focus specifically on the actual code changes made in this PR
- **What areas of the system does this touch (directly or indirectly)?** Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact and regression risks
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Look for potential performance, security, or accessibility implications from the actual code
- **Test recipe based on the diff + other impacted files ‚Äî no guessing, no overtesting**
- **Identify assumptions, missing context, suspicious diffs**
- Prioritize tests by business impact and user dependency:
  - **Critical Priority**: Core functionality that users absolutely depend on (main features, critical paths, essential workflows)
  - **High Priority**: Important supporting functionality that enhances experience but isn't core
  - Examples: User registration/login = Critical, profile customization = High
- Provide concrete, actionable test steps based on the real changes
- Consider the full user journey and potential impact areas
- Include comprehensive test coverage while being specific to this PR
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones
- For Test Recipe: 
  - ONLY include Critical and High priority scenarios
  - Order scenarios by priority (Critical first, then High)
  - Within each priority level, order by relevance to the actual PR changes
  - **For each priority level, include BOTH positive and negative scenarios:**
    - Start with **positive test cases** (happy path, successful workflows)
    - Then include **negative test cases** (error conditions, edge cases, failure scenarios)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Scenario names should be descriptive and concise WITHOUT prefixes like "Positive Scenario:" or "Negative Scenario:"
  - Examples: "User Login Success", "Invalid Credentials", "Password Reset Flow", "Session Timeout"
  - Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality and affected product areas
  - Make steps detailed, actionable, and multiline-friendly
  - Evaluate which scenarios make most sense given the specific changes in the PR
  - **Priority Examples**: User login = Critical, form submission = Critical, data validation = Critical, UI polish = High
- For Questions, Risks & Bugs: 
  - ACTUALLY ANALYZE the code changes to see if they affect other modules/components/files
  - If dependencies are found, specify exactly which files/modules are affected and how
  - If no dependencies found, don't mention generic "could affect" statements
  - Look for actual code issues like missing error handling, potential null pointer exceptions, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or integration problems that are visible in the diff
  - Give concrete results, not generic questions
  - Avoid duplication between questions/risks and bugs - consolidate similar concerns
  - **IMPORTANT**: Always provide exactly 3 items total, with this specific format:
    - 1 Risk: Focus on potential runtime issues, security vulnerabilities, or performance problems
    - 1 Bug: Focus on actual code defects or missing error handling
    - 1 Question: Focus on edge cases or integration concerns
  - **Example format**:
    - **Risk**: "Missing null check for user input could cause runtime errors (line 45)"
    - **Bug**: "No error handling when API call fails (lines 67-72)"
    - **Question**: "How does this handle concurrent user access?"
- For Product Areas: Identify specific features, modules, user flows, or business processes that are directly affected by the code changes
- For Release Pulse Analysis:
  - **User Value**: Infer from PR description and code diff. What is the meaningful value or benefit to the end user?
  - **Release Confidence**: Evaluate test coverage, presence of test files, handling of edge cases, and overall implementation confidence.
  - **Change Impact**: Evaluate scope of code diff ‚Äî number of files, components/modules touched, shared or risky areas.
  - **Release Decision**: Recommend Go or No-Go based on a weighted judgment of the above. Go if value is meaningful, confidence is high/medium, and impact is low/medium. No-Go if confidence is low or impact is high without mitigations.
- For Steps: Use HTML line breaks within table cells to ensure proper formatting:
  - Each step must be on its own line using `<br>` tags
  - Example format: `1. Open the form<br>2. Fill in required fields<br>3. Submit the form`
  - NOT: "1. Open form 2. Fill fields 3. Submit"
  - This ensures the table displays steps as proper numbered lists
