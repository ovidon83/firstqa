# 🎯 Ovi QA Analysis

## 🧪 Test Recipe

| Scenario | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Type | Coverage |
|----------|-------|-----------------|----------|------|----------|
| [Critical feature workflow] | [Complete user journey for main change] | [End-to-end functionality works] | Critical | ✅ Auto | [Product area] |
| [Critical integration test] | [Test integration with affected systems] | [No breaking changes to core flows] | Critical | ✅ Auto | [Integration area] |
| [Critical data validation] | [Verify data consistency across changes] | [Data remains accurate and consistent] | Critical | ❌ Manual | [Data area] |
| [High priority edge case] | [Test boundary conditions from code] | [System handles edge cases gracefully] | High | ❌ Manual | [Edge case area] |
| [High priority regression] | [Test affected product areas for regression] | [Existing functionality remains intact] | High | ❌ Manual | [Regression area] |

## ⚠️ Key Questions & Risks

**Based on actual code changes and diff analysis:**

1. **[Functional]** [Specific question about implementation based on code changes]
2. **[Performance]** [Performance concern from actual code if applicable]
3. **[Security]** [Security risk from code if applicable]
4. **[Integration]** [Integration risk from dependencies if applicable]
5. **[Regression]** [Specific regression risk based on affected product areas]

*Focus on concrete risks from the code, not general best practices. Always specify file names with line numbers.*
