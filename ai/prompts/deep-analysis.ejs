**CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR OUTPUT - THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU ONLY:**

- Focus specifically on the actual code changes made in this PR
- Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact and regression risks
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Look for potential performance, security, or accessibility implications from the actual code
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature + critical path, High = important supporting functionality
- Provide concrete, actionable test steps based on the real changes
- Consider the full user journey and potential impact areas
- Include comprehensive test coverage while being specific to this PR
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones
- For Test Recipe: 
  - ONLY include Critical and High priority scenarios
  - Order scenarios by priority (Critical first, then High)
  - Within each priority level, order by relevance to the actual PR changes
  - Include positive test cases (happy path), negative test cases (error conditions), and edge cases
  - Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality and affected product areas
  - Make steps detailed, actionable, and multiline-friendly
  - Evaluate which scenarios make most sense given the specific changes in the PR
- For Questions, Risks & Bugs: 
  - ACTUALLY ANALYZE the code changes to see if they affect other modules/components/files
  - If dependencies are found, specify exactly which files/modules are affected and how
  - If no dependencies found, don't mention generic "could affect" statements
  - Look for actual code issues like missing error handling, potential null pointer exceptions, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or integration problems that are visible in the diff
  - Give concrete results, not generic questions
  - Avoid duplication between questions/risks and bugs - consolidate similar concerns
- For Product Areas: Identify specific features, modules, user flows, or business processes that are directly affected by the code changes
- For Score Emojis:
  - Release: Combine value + emoji (e.g., "‚úÖ Go", "‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional", "‚ùå Block")
  - Risk: Combine value + emoji (e.g., "üü¢ Low", "üü° Medium", "üî¥ High")
- For Steps: Support multiline text with proper formatting for complex test procedures
