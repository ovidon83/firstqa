**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (Do not include in output):**
- Focus specifically on the actual code changes made in this PR
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature + critical path, High = important supporting functionality, Medium = edge cases and nice-to-haves
- Provide concrete, actionable test steps based on the real changes
- Consider the full user journey and potential impact areas
- Include comprehensive test coverage while being specific to this PR
Behavioral Regression Heuristics (for internal AI reasoning only ‚Äî do not include in output):
	‚Ä¢	When reviewing the diff, build a mental table of DOM nodes or React components where the following props changed: onClick, onKeyDown, tabIndex, role, aria-*, onFocus, onBlur, gesture/drag handlers, or any use of useGesture, onTouchStart, etc.
	‚Ä¢	If a component or DOM node includes both gesture/drag and keyboard/mouse event handlers after the change, flag internally as a possible interaction conflict.
	‚Ä¢	For each affected node/component, cross-reference with known user flows (e.g. capture, urgency switch, selection) and evaluate risk of regression.
	‚Ä¢	Pay special attention to dynamic rendering, reordered elements, or changes in focusable elements that may affect accessibility, keyboard navigation, or interaction behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Suggest a manual test case in the Test Recipe for each significant behavior change that may not be covered by existing automated tests.
