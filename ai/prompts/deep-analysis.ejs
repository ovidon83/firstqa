Based on THESE SPECIFIC CHANGES (not assumptions), answer these 4 questions:

## 1. What's the biggest risk if this code breaks?
Analyze the actual changed code and identify the highest business impact failure scenarios. Consider:
- User-facing functionality affected
- Data integrity risks
- Security implications
- Integration points touched
- Critical user flows impacted

## 2. What should someone test manually before shipping this?
Provide specific test scenarios based on the actual changes made. Include:
- Step-by-step test cases
- Edge cases to verify
- User workflows to validate
- Cross-browser/device considerations if UI changes
- Integration points to test

## 3. What automated tests are missing?
Review the changed code and identify gaps in test coverage:
- New functions/methods without unit tests
- Modified logic missing test updates
- Integration scenarios needing coverage
- Regression tests for bug fixes
- Performance tests if applicable

## 4. Release Assessment
Provide a clear verdict:
- **Risk Level**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL] with justification
- **Ship Score**: [1-10] (10 = ship immediately, 1 = needs major work)

**GUIDELINES:**
- Be specific to the actual changes, not generic
- Prioritize by business impact and user experience
- Give actionable, implementable recommendations  
- Consider startup velocity vs quality tradeoffs
- Flag blockers vs nice-to-haves clearly
- Use examples from the actual code when possible
