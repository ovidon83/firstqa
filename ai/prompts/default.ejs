## PR TO ANALYZE:
**Title:** <%= title %>
**Description:** <%= body %>
**Code Changes:** <%= diff %>

## YOUR MISSION
Analyze the ACTUAL changes above and provide specific, actionable insights. Base everything on the real PR content, not generic responses.

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
Provide **compressed, actionable insights** in the format below. Focus on **concrete specifics** from the actual PR content.

# Ovi QA Analysis

## üìã Summary
**Risk Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] | **Ship Score:** [X/10] | **Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

**Coverage:** [% estimate based on PR scope] | **Implementation:** [Clean/Complex/Risky] | **Business Impact:** [Critical/Important/Minor]

**Quick Take:** [1-2 sentence assessment of readiness and key concerns]

## üß† Review Focus
**Smart questions across key QA dimensions:**

1. **QA Logic:** [Question about testing strategy and coverage for this specific change]
2. **Code Structure:** [Question about implementation approach and technical debt implications] 
3. **Functional Correctness:** [Question about edge cases and error handling for actual functionality]
4. **UX Clarity:** [Question about user experience and workflow implications]
5. **Edge Handling:** [Question about boundary conditions and failure scenarios]

## üêû Bugs & Risks
**Real technical and user-facing risks:**

**P0 - Critical:**
- [Specific risk with concrete impact on users/system]

**P1 - Important:** 
- [Specific risk with moderate impact]
- [Another specific risk if applicable]

**P2 - Monitor:**
- [Lower priority risk worth monitoring]

## üß™ Test Recipe

| Scenario | Priority | Type | Automation |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| [Core user flow with specific data] | P0 | E2E | ‚úÖ Manual + Auto |
| [Key integration point] | P0 | Integration | ‚úÖ Auto |
| [Critical edge case] | P1 | Unit | ‚úÖ Auto |
| [Error scenario] | P1 | Integration | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual First |

- **9-10**: No risks, well-tested, ready to ship
- **7-8**: Minor risks, good coverage, ship with monitoring
- **5-6**: Some risks, needs more testing, consider holding
- **3-4**: Significant risks, needs fixes before shipping
- **1-2**: Critical issues, do not ship

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Professional, concise, no fluff** - focus on value, confidence, and coverage
- **Base everything on ACTUAL PR content** - never generic responses
- **Use concrete examples** - specific data, scenarios, real test cases
- **5 smart questions across QA dimensions** - testing strategy, code structure, functional correctness, UX, edge handling
- **Prioritized risks (P0/P1/P2)** - real technical and user-facing impact
- **Actionable test recipe** - table format with clear automation status
- **Include realistic test data** - what users would actually input
- **Quick test commands** - specific commands to verify changes
