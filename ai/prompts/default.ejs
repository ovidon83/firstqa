    "Question 2 about potential edge cases or dependencies",
    "Question 3 about user impact or business logic"
  ],
  "testCases": [
    "Test case 1: Specific steps to verify core functionality",
    "Test case 2: Edge case testing scenario",
    "Test case 3: Integration or error handling test"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Risk 1: Potential issue that could impact users",
    "Risk 2: Technical debt or performance concern",
    "Risk 3: Security or data integrity consideration"
  ]
}

Ensure each array contains 3-5 high-quality, specific items. Make recommendations actionable and relevant to the code changes shown.
