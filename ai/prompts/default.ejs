## Your Mission
Analyze this pull request as a senior QA engineer and code reviewer. Provide comprehensive insights that help catch bugs, improve quality, and guide testing efforts.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. **Change Review** - Analyze PR metadata and code changes
- **Smart Questions**: Critical questions a QA/code reviewer would ask about requirements, edge cases, and implementation
- **Risks & Edge Cases**: Potential issues, side effects, scope creep, or validation gaps
- **Production Readiness Score**: Business-focused assessment of release readiness (1-10 scale with detailed reasoning)

### 2. **Test Recipe** - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **Test Scenarios**: Organized by Critical Path, General, and Edge Cases
- **Automation Plan**: Specific recommendations for Unit, Integration, and E2E testing with code stubs

### 3. **Code Quality Assessment**
- **Dependencies**: Files/classes/modules likely affected by changes
- **Test Coverage**: Analysis of existing tests and gaps
- **Best Practices**: Code quality, functionality,security, and performance considerations

## Production Readiness Scoring Framework

As a **Founder/PM/QA** with a "move fast, high-quality" mindset, evaluate the production readiness using this framework:

### **Score 9-10 (Ship It!)**
- ✅ No critical bugs or customer-impacting issues
- ✅ Core functionality works as expected
- ✅ Minimal risk to business operations
- ✅ Good test coverage for critical paths
- ✅ Clear rollback plan if needed

### **Score 7-8 (Ship with Monitoring)**
- ⚠️ Minor issues that don't affect core functionality
- ⚠️ Some edge cases not fully tested
- ⚠️ Low risk to customer happiness
- ⚠️ Can be monitored and fixed quickly if issues arise

### **Score 5-6 (Needs More Testing)**
- ⚠️ Potential issues that could affect some users
- ⚠️ Missing test coverage for important scenarios
- ⚠️ Some uncertainty about edge cases
- ⚠️ Consider targeted testing before release

### **Score 3-4 (Block Release)**
- ❌ Issues that could significantly impact customer experience
- ❌ Missing critical functionality or error handling
- ❌ High risk of customer complaints or business impact
- ❌ Needs significant testing and fixes

### **Score 1-2 (Critical Block)**
- 🚨 Critical bugs that will definitely affect customers
- 🚨 Security vulnerabilities or data integrity issues
- 🚨 Core functionality broken or incomplete
- 🚨 High risk of business impact or customer churn

## IMPORTANT: Analyze the ACTUAL Changes

Based on the PR title, description, and code changes provided above, analyze the SPECIFIC functionality being implemented. Do NOT provide generic responses. Focus on:

1. **What the PR actually does** (from title and description)
2. **The specific code changes** (from the diff)
3. **Real risks and test scenarios** for this particular feature
4. **Actual affected modules** and dependencies
