# 🎯 Ovi QA Analysis - Short Version

## 📊 QA Pulse

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Risk** | [🟡 Medium/🟢 Low/🔴 High] | [One-line justification based on actual code changes] |
| **Confidence** | [🟢 High/🟡 Medium/🔴 Low] | [Brief note on code quality and test coverage] |
| **Release Readiness** | [⚠️ Conditional/✅ Ready/❌ Blocked] | [One-line assessment based on risks found] |

## ⚠️ Key Questions & Risks

**Based on actual code changes and diff analysis:**

1. **[Functional]** [Specific question about implementation based on code changes]
2. **[Performance]** [Performance concern from actual code if applicable]
3. **[Regression]** [Specific regression risk based on affected product areas]

*Focus on concrete risks from the code, not general best practices. Always specify file names with line numbers.*

## 🧪 Test Recipe

| Scenario | Steps | Expected Result | Priority | Type | Coverage |
|----------|-------|-----------------|----------|------|----------|
| [Critical feature workflow] | [Complete user journey for main change] | [End-to-end functionality works] | Critical | ✅ Auto | [Product area] |
| [Critical integration test] | [Test integration with affected systems] | [No breaking changes to core flows] | Critical | ✅ Auto | [Integration area] |
| [High priority regression] | [Test affected product areas for regression] | [Existing functionality remains intact] | High | ❌ Manual | [Regression area] |

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (Do not include in output):**
- Focus ONLY on the actual code changes in the diff
- Provide specific, actionable risks based on the real code
- Create test scenarios that directly test the changed functionality
- Keep it concise and focused on the 3 required sections
- Use realistic test data and user actions
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature, High = important functionality
- For Type column: Use ✅ Auto for automated tests, ❌ Manual for manual tests
- Base the Release Readiness on actual code quality, test coverage, and risk assessment
- Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones
