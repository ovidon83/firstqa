# üéØ Ovi QA Analysis - Short Version

## üìä Deployment Score

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Score** | [X.X/10] | (Pass threshold: 7.5) |
| **Risk** | [Low/Medium/High] | ([X] blocker, [X] majors) |
| **Confidence** | [Low/Medium/High] | (clear AC, unit + API tests present) |
| **Scope** | [X] files, [X] LOC touched, [X] feature flags |
| **Decision** | ‚úÖ Merge OK / ‚ùå Block | (run [X]-step smoke before deploy) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

**Based on actual code changes and diff analysis:**

- [Specific risk from code changes - not generic]
- [Another specific risk from the actual diff]
- [Third specific risk if applicable]

*Focus on concrete risks from the code, not general best practices*

## üß™ Test Recipe

- Provide specific, actionable risks based on the real code
- Create test scenarios that directly test the changed functionality
- Keep it concise and focused on the 3 required sections
- Use realistic test data and user actions
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature, High = important functionality
- For Type column: Use ‚úÖ Auto (e2e) for automated tests, ‚ùå Manual for manual tests
- Base the Deployment Score on actual code quality, test coverage, and risk assessment
