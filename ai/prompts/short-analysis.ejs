**CRITICAL: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR OUTPUT - THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU ONLY:**

- Focus ONLY on the actual code changes in the diff
- Provide specific, actionable risks based on the real code
- Create test scenarios that directly test the changed functionality
- Keep it concise and focused on the 5 required sections
- Use realistic test data and user actions
- Prioritize tests by business impact: Critical = main feature, High = important functionality
- Base the Release Readiness on actual code quality, test coverage, and risk assessment
- Analyze affected files deeply to understand product area impact
- Consider dependencies and integration points that might be affected
- Always specify file names with line numbers in questions and risks
- Focus on real, code-based risks, not potential or generic ones
- For Questions & Risks: 
  - ACTUALLY ANALYZE the code changes to see if they affect other modules/components/files
  - If dependencies are found, specify exactly which files/modules are affected and how
  - If no dependencies found, don't mention generic "could affect" statements
  - Look for actual code issues like missing error handling, potential null pointer exceptions, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or integration problems that are visible in the diff
  - Give concrete results, not generic questions
- For Test Recipe: Focus on scenarios that directly test the changed functionality, not generic test cases
- Make every question and risk actionable and specific to the actual code changes
- For Bugs & Issues: Look for actual code problems like syntax errors, logic flaws, missing error handling, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or integration problems visible in the diff
- For Product Areas: Identify specific features, modules, user flows, or business processes that are directly affected by the code changes

**REMEMBER: STOP YOUR OUTPUT AFTER THE "üéØ Product Areas Affected" SECTION. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INSTRUCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL TEXT.**
